The dataset covers 100,000 real and anonymized orders placed between 2016 and 2018 across multiple Olist stores in Brazilian marketplaces.\n",

While he does not yet have a product line or specific location in mind, his goal is to gain an initial overview of the market landscape.\n",

Our analysis is designed to give the stakeholder a clearer understanding of the opportunities within the Brazilian e-commerce sector, highlighting both rapidly growing markets and longer-term untapped potential."
